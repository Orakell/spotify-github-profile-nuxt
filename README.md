# spotify-github-profile-nuxt

Heavily inspired by [kittinan/spotify-github-profile](https://github.com/kittinan/spotify-github-profile).

First contact with Nuxt.js and typescript. Second with Vue.js. And first time using Vercel to host all of this. So this is why nothing make sense.

I was curious about how people were making things appear on their github profiles.

Since the big milestone of this project was outputing a svg on an URL call, I stored all the data and token from the Spotify API in the .env to speedup the process.

I stopped working on it when I discovered all the requirements of the [Spotify Design Guidelines](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/design).
